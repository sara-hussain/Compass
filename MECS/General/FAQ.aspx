    <h1 class="title-h1"> Frequently Asked Questions </h1> 
    <div class="left-content">
    
   <h2 class="title-h2"> 1.	Who will be recruited?</h2>
 
    <p> We are recruiting adult Chicago residents who are 35 years of age or older, speak English, and are US citizens or permanent residents. We will recruit approximately 3,000 participants in the initial phase of the project and will eventually expand the study to include up to 100,000 residents.</p>

<h2 class="title-h2"> 2. What is the purpose of COMPASS? </h2>


<p>By recruiting and following COMPASS participants, we will be able to study disease development and identify opportunities for prevention and treatment. COMPASS is being designed to provide data on exposures and biomarkers that are thought to alter the risk of cancer and other chronic diseases.</p>



<h2 class="title-h2"> 3. Who is conducting the study? </h2>

<p>The study is being conducted by University of Chicago Comprehensive Cancer Center. The COMPASS is run by principal investigators Habibul Ahsan, MD, Michelle Le Beau, PhD, and their colleagues.</p>

    
    
<h2 class="title-h2"> 4. Who is funding the study? </h2>
    
<p>The study is currently funded by The University of Chicago Comprehensive Cancer Center. Once initial recruitment is concluded, we will seek NIH and other external support.</p>   
    
    
<h2 class="title-h2"> 5. How was I recruited for the study? </h2>

<p>We wanted to reach adults living in Chicago that reflect the racial/ethnic distribution of the City. Addresses were used to recruit participants residing in targeted study areas. People who are 35 years of age or older in 2013, speaks English and are US citizens or permanent residents are being targeted for recruitment. </p>  
    
    
<h2 class="title-h2"> 6. Am I still qualified to participate in the study if I moved out of Chicago? </h2>


    <p>Yes, as long as you were a resident of Chicago when you entered the study, you will always remain a study member.</p>

<h2 class="title-h2"> 7.  How will you follow-up on participants over time? </h2>

  <p>Participants will be contacted every two to three years to obtain updated contact and health information as necessary. </p>
   
   
   
  <h2 class="title-h2"> 8.  How will we learn of study results? </h2> 
   
   
   <p>Individual research results will not be given to study par¬ticipants. However, general results that may provide poten¬tial medical benefit will be made available to participants through our annual newsletter, the COMPASS News, as well as the <a href="http://compass.uchicago.edu">COMPASS website</a>.</p>
    
 <h2 class="title-h2"> 9. How often will I receive a COMPASS Newsletter?</h2> 

 <p>Once a year.</p>
    
 
 <h2 class="title-h2"> 10. Why am I so important? </h2> 
 
 <p>Input from each and every member is critical to the success of the study. We cannot ask anyone else to take your place; only the original group of people who started the study once recruited can help us to complete the study successfully.</p>
 
 
 <h2 class="title-h2"> 11. Is my response to the questionnaire important? </h2> 
 
 <p>Yes, it is crucial. The accuracy of scientific studies, like COMPASS, depends critically on participation. If the participation rate is low, with lots of people opting not to participate, there will be doubt that the results are correct.</p>
 
 <h2 class="title-h2"> 12. Why are we collecting blood and urine specimens? </h2> 

 <p>Biological specimens are used for many types of medical and public health research. They will enable us to examine the relationship between components (e.g., environmental toxins) measured in blood and urine and their interactions with genetic (hereditary) and/or modifiable lifestyle and behavioral factors that contribute toward disease development.</p>

<h2 class="title-h2"> 13. What do I receive in return for participating in the study? </h2> 

<p>Participants will receive $50 for their efforts. We also hope it’s gratifying to know that your contribution to our research will benefit people now and in the future by bringing us closer to understanding the causes and means for prevention of cancer and chronic diseases. You will receive the COMPASS News every year which is a newsletter for study participants. We will bring you up to date on the study’s activities and research findings. </p>


 <h2 class="title-h2"> 14. Will I receive any research results? </h2> 

 <p>Because this is a research project, we will not be releasing the results of any individual research tests. Information learned from the research that could be of possible medical benefit will be provided to you through our annual newsletter, the COMPASS News. </p>



<h2 class="title-h2"> 15.  Can participants have input into the decision about what health issues will be studied?</h2> 
 
 <p>Yes. If you have suggestions, please let us know by emailing us, calling us or writing to us.</p>
 
 <h2 class="title-h2"> 16.  Who can I contact if I have questions about the COMPASS? </h2> 
 
 <p>You can call our toll-free number, 1-855-726-6727, to reach study investigators and research staff or you can email us at <a href="mailto:compass@uchicago.edu">compass@uchicago.edu</a> </p>
