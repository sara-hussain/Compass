    The ChicagO Multiethnic Prevention and Surveillance Study (<b>COMPASS</b>) is a health study designed by researchers at the University of Chicago to understand how lifestyle, healthcare-related factors, environment, and genetics affect health. In Chicago, disparities relating to cancer and other chronic diseases, such as diabetes, cardiovascular, and respiratory diseases, are often worse than those observed in other areas in the United States. By identifying the determinants of these diseases, we aim to develop new strategies to prevent cancer and other chronic diseases among Chicagoans.
