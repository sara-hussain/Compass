    <div class="left-content">
    <h2 class=title-h2>Purpose</h2>
    <p>
    COMPASS was established to examine lifestyle risk factors, especially diet, nutrition and environment as well as genetic susceptibility (an inherited tendency to react more strongly to particular exposures) in relation to the development of cancer and other chronic diseases.
    </p>

    <h2 class='title-h2'>How the Study will be Conducted</h2>
    <p>Every participant will complete a specially designed interview including health related questions at the beginning of the study. The interview will ask about lifestyle, environmental exposure and health related information as well as medical history. Every participant will also provide a biological sample to look at genetic susceptibility and other molecular factors.</p>


<h2 class='title-h2'> Follow-up</h2>
<p>The Illinois state cancer registry will be used to identify COMPASS participants who develop cancer. This registry was established to monitor the progress of the disease and public health efforts to control it. In addition, follow-up questionnaires will be mailed to participants to collected updated information on health status and lifestyle changes.</p>

<h2 class="title-h2">Vision</h2> 

<p>Over the next several years, COMPASS investigators will be testing many different hypotheses related to lifestyle, environment and other factors in order to determine why different individuals or groups have different risks of developing cancer and other chronic diseases.</p>

<h2 class="title-h2">Mission Statement</h2>
<p>Our mission is to collect information that will significantly contribute to efforts to prevent cancer and other chronic diseases in Chicago and nationwide</p>
