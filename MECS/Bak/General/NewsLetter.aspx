   <b> Dear Participant,  </b>
     

   <p> Happy New Year! The CMEC Study is still enrolling participants but we have almost reached our 
   recruitment goal thanks to your participation. Since the study began, we have enrolled nearly 
   100,000 persons. We will be publishing information describing the enrolled participants by age, 
   gender, race and location of residence shortly.  In the coming year, we will begin to publish on
    some important findings already for obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular health. </p>
    

<p> In future issues of our annual newsletter, we will report on important findings from articles 
published during 2014. This year we plan to look at………… These reports will help us understand
 more about cancer and how it might be prevented. This information will make a significant 
 contribution to public health!  </p>

  

<p> Without your participation, none of this would be possible. We invite you to visit the study 
website for news, contact information and the complete list of articles from the study at 
<a href="#"> http://www.XXXXXXXXXXXX/ </a> </p>
Thank you for your continued time and participation in the Chicago Multiethnic Cohort Study!
