    <h1 class="title-h1"> Frequently Asked Questions </h1> 
    <div class="left-content">
    
   <h2 class="title-h2"> 1. What is the purpose of The Chicago Multiethnic Cohort (MEC) Study?</h2>
 
    <p> By recruiting 100,000 participants into a Chicago Multiethnic Cohort Study (CMEC) and conducting 
    multiple decades of follow-up, we will be able to answer some of the etiologic questions and identify 
    opportunities for prevention. The Chicago Multiethnic Cohort Study will be designed to provide data 
    on exposures and biomarkers that are thought to alter the risk of cancer and other chronic diseases. 
     </p>

<h2 class="title-h2"> 2. Who is conducting the study? </h2>


<p>The study is being conducted by University of Chicago Comprehensive Cancer Center. The CMEC is run 
by principal investigators Habibul Ahsan, MD, Michelle Le Beau, PhD, and Richard Schilsky, MD,</p>



<h2 class="title-h2"> 3. Who is funding the study? </h2>

<p>The study is currently funded by The University of Chicago Comprehensive Cancer Center. Once initial 
recruitment is concluded, we will seek NIH support.</p>

    
    
<h2 class="title-h2"> 4. How was I recruited for the study? </h2>
    
<p>We wanted to reach adults living in Chicago that reflect the racial/ethnic distribution of the City.
 Addresses were used to recruit participants residing in targeted study areas. People who are the age
  of 45 or older in 2012,  English speaking and permanent residents or citizens were recruited </p>   
    
    
<h2 class="title-h2"> 5. Am I still qualified to participate in the study if I moved out of Chicago? </h2>

<p>Yes, as long as you were a resident of Chicago when you entered the study between 2012 and 2013 you 
will always remain a study member. </p>  
    
    
<h2 class="title-h2"> 6. How will you follow-up on participants over time? </h2>


    <p>Every 2 years, we will re-contact participants. It is necessary to have updated information from 
    our participants in order to continue our important research.</p>

<h2 class="title-h2"> 7.  How will we learn of study results? </h2>

  <p>Our regular newsletters will update you as new findings emerge. This website will be updated with the 
  information published in the newsletters and will provide a description of all study results and 
  the reference you would need to locate any articles that are published using CMEC data. </p>
   
   
   
  <h2 class="title-h2"> 8.  How often will I receive a CMEC Newsletter? </h2> 
   
   
   Once a year.
    
 <h2 class="title-h2"> 9. Why am I so important?</h2> 

 <p>You are a very important member of the original cohort that started this study. Input from each and every member 
 of this initial group is critical to the success of the study. We cannot ask anyone else to take your place; only the 
 original group of people who started the study can help us.</p>
    
 
 <h2 class="title-h2"> 10. Is my response to the questionnaire important? </h2> 
 
 <p>Yes, it is crucial. The accuracy of scientific studies like the CMEC depends critically on 
 participation. If the participation rate is low, with lots of people opting not to return the 
 questionnaire, there will be doubt that the results are correct.</p>
 
 
 <h2 class="title-h2"> 11. Why do you collect blood and urine specimens? </h2> 
 
 <p>These specimens can be used for many kinds of research. Primarily, they complement the information from 
 the questionnaires by enabling us to examine the relation of components measured in blood and urine 
 to the risk of cancer. They are also used to study the interaction between genetic susceptibility 
 (an inherited tendency to react more strongly to particular exposures) and lifestyle or environment 
 in relation to the causation of cancer. The ultimate goal is to identify ways to prevent cancer. </p>
 
 <h2 class="title-h2"> 12. What do I receive in return for participating in the study? </h2> 

 <p>We hope it’s gratifying to know that your contribution to our research will benefit people now and in
  the future by bringing us closer to understanding the causes and means for prevention of cancer.<br />
You will receive the CMEC News every year which is a newsletter for study participants. We will bring 
you up to date on the study’s activities and research findings.</p>

<h2 class="title-h2"> 13. Will I receive any research results? </h2> 

<p>Because this is a research project, we will not be releasing the results of any individual research 
tests. Information learned from the research that could be of possible medical benefit will be
 provided to you through our annual newsletter, the CMEC News. </p>


 <h2 class="title-h2"> 14. If I have a medical question, can the CMEC help me? </h2> 

 <p>We can help you find sources of information, but we cannot give advice on specific medical problems.
  Only your doctors and nurses have sufficient information to help you make decisions about care and
   treatment. If you are in doubt about the care you are getting, it is useful to get a second opinion. </p>



<h2 class="title-h2"> 15.  Can participants have input into the decision about what health issues will be studied?</h2> 
 
 <p>Yes. If you have suggestions, please let us know by emailing us, calling us or writing to us.</p>
 
 <h2 class="title-h2"> 16.  Who can I contact if I have questions about the CMEC? </h2> 
 
 <p>You can call our toll-free number, 1-800-XXX-XXXX, to reach study investigators and research staff or 
 you can email us at <a href="mailto:cmec@uchicago.edu">cmec@uchicago.edu</a> </p>
