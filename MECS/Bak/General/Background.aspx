    <h1 class=title-h1>Background </h1>
    
    <div class="left-content">
    <h2 class=title-h2>Purpose</h2>
    <p>
    The CMEC Study was established to examine lifestyle risk factors, especially diet and nutrition, 
    as well as genetic susceptibility (an inherited tendency to react more strongly to particular exposures) 
    in relation to the causation of cancer and other chronic diseases.
    </p>
    <h2 class='title-h2'>How the Cohort will be Established</h2>
    <p>Every cohort member will complete a specially designed, interview on health related 
    questionnaire at entry to the CMEC Study. The interview will ask about background information as well as 
    medical, medication, physical activity and female reproductive histories. Every cohort member will also provide a 
    biological sample to look at genetic susceptibility and other molecular factors.</p>


<h2 class='title-h2'> Follow-up</h2>
Persons in the cohort who develop cancer will be identified through the Illinois state cancer registry that was established to monitor the progress of the disease and public health efforts to control it.
In addition to the baseline questionnaire other questionnaires will be mailed to CMEC participants to get additional information on new diseases and changes in health and lifestyle. 


<h2 class="title-h2">Vision</h2> 

Over the next several years, CMEC investigators will be testing may different hypotheses related to lifestyle and environment and other factors in order to determine why different racial/ethnic groups have different risks of developing cancer and other chronic diseases.
<h2 class="title-h2">Mission Statement</h2>
Our mission is to make a significant contribution to the goal of preventing cancer and other chronic diseases in the populations of the U.S. and the rest of the world.
