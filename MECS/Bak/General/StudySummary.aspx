    <b>The Chicago Multiethnic Cohort(CMEC)</b> is a large study designed by researchers at the University of Chicago to better understand 
    how lifestyle, environment and genetic makeup affect the development and progression of cancer and other chronic diseases. 
    By identifying the factors that increase the risk of these diseases, we will be able to target opportunities for prevention.
    In Chicago, health disparities relating to cancer and other chronic diseases (such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes) are
    often worse than is observed in other areas in the United States. The goal of this project is to improve the prevention, diagnosis 
    and treatment of cancer and other diseases and to promote health in Chicago. To achieve this, we are enrolling people in the study 
    who represent the general population of the City of Chicago and asking them to provide an array of potentially very important information.
    We plan to recruit about 100,000 people and we would like to follow-up with the participants for many years. This will help us get answers 
    to important questions about cancer and other chronic diseases that often disproportionately affect groups in Chicago and other urban centers.
     By assessing factors possibly related to health in our study population many years before a disease develops, we will be able to better understand the causes 
     of cancer and other chronic diseases and how they might be prevented.
